              The Au Pair category of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program allows a
              caring live-in childcare provider between the ages of 18 and 26 to
              live as an extended member of a host family in exchange for room,
              board, and a stipend. Whilst the main priority of a successful
              applicant will be to take care of the kids, they should also have
              free time to enjoy life in the U.S.

            <li className="pagepara">
              The Au Pair program offers an amazing intercultural experience for
              both participants and host families. For the participants, this is
              an opportunity to continue their education while living with an
              American family and become part of the family. On the other hand,
              the hosts benefit from having a reliable and responsible childcare
              provider. It is truly a mutually rewarding experience.
