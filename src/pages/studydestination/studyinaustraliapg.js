          <ul className="pageul">
            <li className="pagepara">
              The cost of living for International students in Australia is
              significantly lower than in Countries like the US and UK.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li className="pagepara">
              An average International student in Australia will spend around
              AU$700-1000 on living expenses, including accommodation, food,
              transport, phone and entertainment.

              The Department of Immigration and Multiculturalism advises

              Your choice of study location and living arrangements can have a
              significant impact on your expenses while in Australia. For
              instance, residing in a spacious suburban area is generally less
              expensive than living in the bustling city center. Moreover, your
              mode of transportation can greatly influence your costs - opting
              for a bike or public transit is typically more cost-effective than
              purchasing and maintaining a personal vehicle.

          adults. Homestay is usually arranged by an educational Institution to
          ensure that the students are placed with an appropriate family. This

          students and English learners . Accommodation fees range from $110 to

          room but share the living area, kitchen and laundry room. Rent,
          electricity, gas and phone costs are shared. You can live alone if you

          the style of the house or apartment. For one person in the roommate,
          the fee is $70 to $250 per week. Renting an entire apartment or house
