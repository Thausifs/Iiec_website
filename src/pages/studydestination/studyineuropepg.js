            It is common to find that the cost of living in Europe is relatively
            high, and with the current exchange rate, it may seem steep for
            Americans as well. However, Europeans are adept at living well, even
            those with limited financial resources can enjoy a good quality of
            life. In some rich European countries, like Finland and the
            Netherlands, the one and two-cent euro coins have been taken out of
            circulation, and prices may seem expensive for locals.If you travel
            like a European, you can live well, too—enjoying a memorable and
            affordable trip anywhere in Europe, traveling “through the back
            door” for €100 a day. If everyone says, “Portugal is cheap,” but
            your travel dreams are taking you to the Swiss Alps, then your best
            value is in Switzerland by traveling smartly.
