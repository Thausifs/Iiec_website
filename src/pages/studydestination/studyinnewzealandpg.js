          <p className="pagepara">
            New Zealand, located in the South Pacific Ocean, is an archipelago
            comprising over 700 islands. The two largest islands, the North and
            South Islands, which are comparable in size to Japan or the United
            Kingdom, are where most of the population resides. The country lies
            on the Pacific Ring of Fire, offering a spectacular and fertile
            landscape with volcanoes, geothermal parks, and hot springs. New
            Zealanders, also known as Kiwis, are renowned for their independence
            and innovation, and the majority of the population is of European
            descent, while the indigenous Maori comprise approximately 15%.
            Maori culture, language, and heritage are integrated throughout the
            cultural and social context. Worship centers for most religions can
            be found, and the country celebrates Christian holidays like
            Christmas and Easter, as well as festivals of other cultures and
            religions throughout the year. The official languages in New Zealand
            are English, Maori, and Sign Language.

            In New Zealand, graduates with degrees in science, engineering,
            management, and business tend to earn higher salaries compared to
            graduates with degrees in creative arts, culinary and arts, food,
            hospitality, and personal services. For those interested in studying
            in New Zealand, there are free educational advice services available
            to assist with enrollment and a range of support services for

            There is no age limit for studying in New Zealand, but the New
            Zealand Immigration Service must ensure that applicants are actual
            students when processing student visa applications. The country has
            8 universities, 25 polytechnics and/or institutes of technology, and
            approximately 440 secondary schools, and its education providers
            offer 'national' and/or self-developed qualifications.

          temperature between summer and winter, with the most continental
          climate experienced in Central Otago, inland from Dunedin. During the

          The Ministry of Education operates a Code of Practice for the Pastoral
          Care of International Students. The Code (introduced in October 2002)
          provides a framework for delivery of pastoral care, accommodation and
          provision of information by education providers and their agents to
          International students. It sets out minimum standards of advice and
          care that are expected of education providers. All education providers
          that enrol International students must be signatories to the Code.

          Providers of international education services must ensure they have
          fair and equitable internal procedures in place for resolving student
          grievances. If students are dissatisfied with the outcome of their
          complaint, they may contact the International Education Appeal
          Authority. This Authority investigates complaints and evaluates
          whether there has been a breach of the Code, and provides remedies if
          a breach is found. The Code can be found on the website of the
          Ministry of Education. NZQA has delegated its authority for the
          approval and accreditation of polytechnics and institutes of
          technology courses below degree level to the Institutes of Technology
          and Polytechnics of New Zealand (ITPNZ) and its Polytechnic Programmes
