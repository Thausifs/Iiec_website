          <p className="pagebold">Climate:</p>
          <p className="pagepara">
            There are many climates in Canada and they vary from permanently
            frozen ice caps north of the 70th parallel to lush vegetation on the
            west coast of British Columbia. Overall, however, Canada has four
            very distinct seasons, especially in the more densely populated
            areas along the US border. Daytime temperatures in summer can soar
            to 35°C and beyond, while lows of -15°C are not uncommon in winter.
            Above moderate temperatures are the norm in spring and fall. Over
            the past years, Canadians have adapted very well to colder weather
            by installing heating in homes and cars, and heating up public
            transportation systems.

          Getting around Canada is easy. Most cities have urban transportation
          systems, including buses, trams, and trains, and some larger cities
          have subways. You can board these systems at regular stops along their
          route. Some allow you to pay cash, others require a ticket. If you
          don't have bus ticket, you have to pay with exact amount (exact fare).
          You can also purchase a monthly subscription or ticket bundle to save
          money. You can buy metro tickets at the metro station. Route maps and
          timetables are usually available from the transit company in your

          The Canadian education system includes both public and private
          schools, from kindergarten to University. Education is a provincial
          responsibility under Canada's constitution, which means there are
          significant differences between the education systems of different
          provinces. However, the National standard is uniformly high.
        </p>
        <p className="pagebold">Universities:</p>
        <p className="pagepara">
          Canada has many Universities and colleges located in urban and rural
          areas in all parts of the Country. Its Universities are
          Internationally recognized for the quality of their teaching and
          research. Degrees from Canadian Universities ranked are equivalent to
          degrees from American Universities and other Commonwealth
          Universities. Universities in Canada are largely publicly funded;
          therefore, they have a consistent quality, regardless of location or
          field of study. In addition, they all have a high degree of academic
          autonomy.
        </p>
        <p className="pagepara">
          The number of full-time students enrolled at individual Universities
          ranges from less than 1000 students to more than 35,000 at major
          Universities. Also, most Universities have a large number of part-time
          or continuing education students. They offer a wide range of courses
          and cover levels ranging from Under Graduate to PhD and can offer
          professional certificates and degrees. Fees for Universities vary by
          province, Institution and program of study.

        <p className="pagebold">Education Cost:</p>
        <p className="pagepara">
          Tuition fees vary depending on the degree and type of university
          chosen. To cover this would require somewhere between 13,000 CAD and
          35,000 CAD per year.
        </p>
        <p className="pagepara">
          Most commonly, humanities, education, and art courses tend to be
          slightly cheaper, while subjects such as medicine and engineering tend
          to be more expensive. If you want to study at the postgraduate level,
          tuition fees are usually higher and costs vary by program. As in most
          other countries, MBA programs are often the most expensive. The
          average cost of these programs is between $30,000 and $42,000 CAD.

          Canada's University colleges provide a solid foundation of academic
          and applied programs on campus. As the name suggests, a University
          college offers Under Graduate degrees as well as associate degree and
          certificate programs. Students can expect to find a variety of program
          options at University colleges, including English as a Second Language
          (ESL) programs. As part of the Canadian University system, University
          colleges offer students a choice of practice-oriented college or
          University degree programs over diplomas and certificates. Part of
          Canada's college system, University colleges are distinguished by
          outstanding student support services, small class sizes, and a strong
          campus environment. They may also offer degree/combined programs and

          Community Colleges of Canada (ACCC) officially known by various
          titles, including Community College, Technical Institute, College and
          Cégep. All of these Institutions have the main function of meeting the
          training needs of business, industrial and public service sectors.
          They also meet the educational needs of career-oriented high school
          graduates, job-seeking college graduates, as well as the lifelong
          learning needs of the adult population. Historically, all of these
          Institutions offer degrees, as community needs change and evolve, and
          at least 18 Institutions now offer degrees and applied degrees. Under
          Graduate programs of two to three years (or shorter) often offer
          specific career-oriented programs, as well as a general academic
          focus.

          A technical/vocational college is a privately owned and operated

          market after a short period of study. In technical/vocational
          colleges, practical skills are emphasized in a variety of programs.
          They can specialize in specific areas such as business, computing and
          secretarial skills. Although privately owned, these schools are
          approved and administered by the Province, ensuring that the standards
          and quality of the programs are maintained. Career colleges have very
          competitive tuition structures.
